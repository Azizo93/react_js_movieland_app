# react_js_movieland_app

This repository contains the SRC folder with the files needed to run the MovieLand app I have created. 
You will need to first install react via the terminal of your chosen code editor.

This  app is inteded to demonstate the use of React via HTML CSS and JS. I have also incorporated an API from OMDB-API to help demonstrate the use of JSON.
